Diabetes Prediction Model
Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting diabetes based on key medical indicators. 
The model utilizes the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm from the scikit-learn library and is trained on a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Dataset 

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains the following features:

Pregnancies
Glucose
BloodPressure
SkinThickness
Insulin
BMI
DiabetesPedigreeFunction
Age
Outcome (target variable) Â  
Dataset URL: (https://www.kaggle.com/code/paultimothymooney/predict-diabetes-from-medical-records)

Dependencies

Python
scikit-learn
Model Architecture

The project employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The model is trained using a portion of the dataset and evaluated on a separate testing set.

Usage

Clone the repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-prediction-model.git
Use code with caution.

Install dependencies:
Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.

Run the model:
Bash
python diabetes_predictor.py
Use code with caution.

Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Future Work

Explore other machine learning algorithms for potential performance improvements.
Conduct hyperparameter tuning to optimize the SVM model.
Incorporate additional features or datasets to enhance model accuracy.
